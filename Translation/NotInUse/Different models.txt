ONMT: Variability between the different versions of the software, I.E. the exclusion of a built in preprocess function after version 1.2, makes it very difficult to build a working model with any confidence that it will be sustainable for any foreseeable future and not just cease functioning after the next software update.

issues with uploaded model represent this, as it does not function specifically because of the use of the preprocess function

FairSeq: Limited Language support

issue with uploaded model is that it does not translate to other languages. Instead it just takes the input and presents the output as the same.

FineTune: I was attempting to fine tune the model in order to improve its accuracy with more common languages.
