# Configuration Google Cloud Speech-to-Text

Follow these steps to set up Google Cloud, and configure the API for real-time speech recognition.

## Step 1: Set Up a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on **Select a Project** at the top, and then **New Project** to create a new one.
3. Give your project a name and click **Create**.

## Step 2: Enable the Speech-to-Text API
1. In the Google Cloud Console, ensure your new project is selected.
2. In the left-hand menu, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
3. Search for **Speech-to-Text API** and click on it, then select **Enable**.

## Step 3: Set Up Authentication
1. Under **APIs & Services**, go to **Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials** and select **Service Account**.
3. Give it a name, set the **Role** to **Project > Owner**, and complete the creation steps.
4. Once created, click on the service account and go to the **Keys** tab, then click **Add Key > Create New Key**.
5. Select **JSON** format, and a key file will download. Keep this file secure, as it contains the credentials your project needs to access the API.

## Step 4: Install the Google Cloud Client Library
In your project environment, install the Google Cloud Speech client library using pip:

```
pip install google-cloud-speech
```

---

## Step 5: Set Up the Authentication Environment Variable
Set an environment variable to allow your application to access Google Cloud services:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your-service-account-file.json"
```

## Step 6: Implement the Speech-to-Text API in Your Code
Here’s a Python example for real-time speech recognition using Google’s streaming API to process audio input and get transcriptions:

```python
from google.cloud import speech

# Instantiates a client
client = speech.SpeechClient()
```
